# Innoloft frontend Challenge

This is my solution for the frontend coding challenge 

# Setup 
- Make sure yarn is installed
- install dependencies "yarn install"
- Run the project "yarn dev" for development
- "yarn build" && "yarn preview" for production view
- Install the "Moesif CORS" Chrome extension to solve the CORS issue and turn it on

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
